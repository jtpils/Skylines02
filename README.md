# [SKYLINES](www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2014/skylines/)

This series of projects is about awareness - more precisely about the tools and techniques we use to see the world around us.

These projects are part of an ongoing [process](http://www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2014/skylines/process.php) nourished by different motivations during my last year as a Parson's MFA DT student and presented as three explorations around the theme of  Landscape.

# SKYLINE II

Device that shows the invisible transitions of the horizon as it moves from the city to the mountains. While _Skyline #01_ sees through the flow of the time, _Skyline #02_ expands our perception of space.
